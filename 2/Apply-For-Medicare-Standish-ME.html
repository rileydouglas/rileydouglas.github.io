<p>I am now ready to see what, if any of the outstanding bills, might be covered by Medicare Part A. Thank you on your assist Mr. Backman. You don’t have to sign up for Medicare this 12 months should you don’t need to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare nicely after sixty five, you need to half HSA contributions six months before you signal as much as avoid tax penalties because of Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can proceed contributing to your HSA as long as you’re not on Medicare.
