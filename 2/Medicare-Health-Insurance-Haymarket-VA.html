<p>If your husband has a group health plan and works for a corporation of 20 individuals or extra, he does not have to join Medicare at sixty five. If he takes Part A solely, which is free, Medicare shall be his secondary.<p>
<p>As a general rule, people who plan to continue to work (and have employer-sponsored health coverage) previous age sixty five must discuss with the employer-sponsored health plan to see whether or not they need to enroll in Part B or not.

As a result of these choices, you might have variations in your Medicare benefits. There are 4 “elements” to the Medicare insurance program, each one offering a sure set of Medicare benefits.<p>
