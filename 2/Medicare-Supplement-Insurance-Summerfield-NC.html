<p>I am now waiting to see what, if any of the outstanding payments, shall be coated by Medicare Part A. Thank you for your help Mr. Backman. You don’t have to enroll in Medicare this yr when you don’t want to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare nicely after 65, you need to half HSA contributions six months before you signal as much as avoid tax penalties because of Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can continue contributing to your HSA so long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to cease contributions six months previous to retiring/signing up for Medicare as a result of if you enroll well after age sixty five (which it sounds like you’re planning on doing), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>
<p>Is the 6 month retroactive interval for medicare from the day medicare coverage starts or the day you apply for medicare coverage. Do I actually have to cease HSA contributions on April 1 or May 1 (6 months back from date coverage begins.<p>
