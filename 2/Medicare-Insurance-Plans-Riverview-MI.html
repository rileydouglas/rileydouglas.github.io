<p>I would recommend addressing that issue with a union representative and going from there. Some folks choose to pay for health coverage through an employer plus Medicare. If you’re not being given a alternative then that’s something to first address with the entity that’s forcing you to obtain Medicare.<p>
<p>The Medicare Rights Center was not capable of verify that all ministries work this fashion, however it might be sensible so that you can contemplate that your ministry has such a requirement. Your review should embrace whether or not there may be coverage for prescription drugs. These aren't covered by Parts A or B, however usually require a Part D drug plan from a non-public insurer.

Work with your main care provider and your family to choose a plan that you could afford and that has the coverages you’ll use probably the most. Advantage plans restrict what you'll be able to pay out-of-pocket for coverage.<p>
