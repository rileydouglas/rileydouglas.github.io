<p>If you aren't signing up for Medicare at 65 and at present have company provided group coverage, are you required to verify this with Medicare?

<p>Even if you are glad together with your present Medicare coverage, look at other Medicare options in your area that will better fit your particular person needs within the upcoming year. For example, check to see if there may be one other plan in your area that can offer you higher health and/or drug coverage at a more inexpensive price.
