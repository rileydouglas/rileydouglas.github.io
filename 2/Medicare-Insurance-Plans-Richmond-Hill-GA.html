This comes with an employer request for data form known as L564. Your employer can fill in that you’ve had coverage through them since the month you turned sixty five, thus qualifying you for particular enrollment into Medicare Part B. Unfortunately I’m not familiar with union laws mandating that you sign up for Medicare at a given time.<p>
<p>If you don’t enroll in Part B, your insurer will “claw back” the amount it paid for your care when it finds out. At that point, you would wish to enroll in Part B, however might not qualify for the SEP when you delayed enrolling for greater than eight months.

You can join Part A at sixty five should you choose and use it as secondary insurance in case you need hospital care.<p>
<p>You can delay your Part B effective date as much as three months should you enroll when you nonetheless have employer-sponsored coverage or inside one month after that coverage ends.
