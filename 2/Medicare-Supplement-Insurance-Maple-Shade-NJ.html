<p>These people will get a packet of data a couple of months before they flip sixty five or receive their twenty fifth month of Social Security Disability or Railroad Retirement Board benefits. At that time, they'll choose to keep or decline Part B, but can’t decline Part A until they withdraw their authentic application for Social Security and pay back all Social Security cash benefits.
