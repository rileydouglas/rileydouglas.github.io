<p>I am now ready to see what, if any of the outstanding bills, shall be coated by Medicare Part A. Thank you for your assist Mr. Backman. You don’t have to enroll in Medicare this yr when you don’t wish to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare well after 65, you need to half HSA contributions six months earlier than you sign as much as keep away from tax penalties as a result of Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can continue contributing to your HSA so long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to stop contributions six months prior to retiring/signing up for Medicare because should you enroll properly after age 65 (which it sounds like you’re planning on doing), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>
<p>Generally you can enroll in Medicare solely through the Medicare basic enrollment period . Generally, if a person remains to be working and has employer-sponsored Group Health Plan coverage based on that employment, they will delay enrollment in Part B and can enroll later throughout a SEP. For instance, employer coverage for retirees or through COBRA doesn’t depend as current employment, so these people don’t qualify for a SEP to enroll in Medicare later.<p>

<p>But it looks like you’ll be enrolling at Medicare at 65, by which case you don’t get retro benefits since you weren’t entitled to them prior to 65. Hi Karen, whenever you enroll in Medicare Part A, you may be penalized for persevering with to contribute to an HSA. Your Part A will take effect back to the date you qualified for Medicare .<p>
