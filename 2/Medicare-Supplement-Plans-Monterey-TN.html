<p>If you’re covered under a spouse’s group health plan at an organization with 20 or extra staff, you don't want to sign up for Medicare at 65. The six months of retroactive benefits applies when you enroll in Medicare after sixty five. At that point it’s computerized and you may’t settle for or reject it – it simply happens.

Seniors are typically advised to sign up on time to keep away from penalties that might show quite pricey over the course of retirement.<p>
