<p>As a common rule, people who plan to continue to work (and have employer-sponsored health coverage) previous age 65 must check with the employer-sponsored health plan to see whether they should enroll in Part B or not.

Your employer can fill in that you simply’ve had coverage by way of them for the reason that month you turned sixty five, thus qualifying you for particular enrollment into Medicare Part B.
