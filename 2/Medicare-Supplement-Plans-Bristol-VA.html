Prior authorization is most often required for comparatively expensive companies, corresponding to inpatient hospital stays, skilled nursing facility stays, and Part B medication, but sometimes required for preventive providers. Beginning in 2019, Medicare Advantage plans also can require enrollees to use “step remedy” for Part B medicine, meaning that they are required to try some specific medicine before they receive approval to attempt other medication.
