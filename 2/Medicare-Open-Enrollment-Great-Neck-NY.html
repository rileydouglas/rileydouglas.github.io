<p>I am now ready to see what, if any of the outstanding payments, will be lined by Medicare Part A. Thank you for your assist Mr. Backman. You don’t have to join Medicare this year should you don’t want to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare properly after sixty five, you must half HSA contributions six months earlier than you sign as much as avoid tax penalties as a result of Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can continue contributing to your HSA as long as you’re not on Medicare.
