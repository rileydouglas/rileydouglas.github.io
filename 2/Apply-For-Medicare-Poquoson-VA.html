<p>Yes, you can enroll in Medicare at sixty five and cease paying premiums for your current insurance. The six months of retroactive coverage applies if you sign up for Medicare after age sixty five. At that time, when you enroll, your coverage dates again to either six months, or your sixty fifth birthday — whichever is shorter. It doesn’t matter in case your employer has 20 full-time or half-time workers; the threshold is 20 to be thought of a group health plan for Medicare particular enrollment functions.<p>

<p>As a general rule, people who plan to proceed to work (and have employer-sponsored health coverage) past age sixty five have to confer with the employer-sponsored health plan to see whether or not they should enroll in Part B or not. This comes with an employer request for information form often known as L564. Your employer can fill in that you’ve had coverage through them since the month you turned sixty five, thus qualifying you for special enrollment into Medicare Part B. Unfortunately I’m not conversant in union legal guidelines mandating that you just join Medicare at a given time.<p>
<p>Medicare Advantage plans may charge decrease premiums than you’d pay for Medicare plus a medigap coverage and Part D prescription-drug coverage. But you can find yourself paying higher out-of-pocket costs all year long. Private Medicare Advantage plans can be a whole lot for seniors looking for all-in-one medical and drug coverage.

You could choose not to enroll in Medicare Part B if you end up first eligible since you are already coated by group medical insurance via an employer or union.<p>
<p>You can delay your Part B efficient date up to three months if you enroll while you nonetheless have employer-sponsored coverage or inside one month after that coverage ends. Otherwise, your Part B coverage will start the month after you enroll. The Part B SEP allows beneficiaries to delay enrollment if they have health coverage via their own or a spouse’s present employer.<p>
<p>Be positive to consider how you will pay for the things Medicare would not cover. For instance, it usually would not cover dental work and routine imaginative and prescient or hearing care.
