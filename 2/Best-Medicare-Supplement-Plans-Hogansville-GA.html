<p>I am now waiting to see what, if any of the outstanding bills, might be lined by Medicare Part A. Thank you on your help Mr. Backman.

If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare well after sixty five, you must half HSA contributions six months earlier than you signal up to keep away from tax penalties as a result of Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can proceed contributing to your HSA as long as you’re not on Medicare.

If you could have group health coverage via an employer with 20 or extra people, that insurance is your major and Medicare is your secondary. I can’t inform you when to join Social Security, however I can tell you there are benefits to waiting.
