<p>You may be eligible for Medicare Part B enrollment earlier than 65 when you have end-stage renal disease or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (also known as ALS, or Lou Gehrig’s disease).

This comes with an employer request for information form known as L564. Your employer can fill in that you just’ve had coverage via them for the reason that month you turned sixty five, thus qualifying you for particular enrollment into Medicare Part B. Unfortunately I’m not acquainted with union laws mandating that you join Medicare at a given time.<p>
