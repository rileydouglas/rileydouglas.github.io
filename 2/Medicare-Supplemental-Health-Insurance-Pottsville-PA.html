<p>I am now ready to see what, if any of the outstanding bills, will be lined by Medicare Part A. Thank you in your assist Mr. Backman. You don’t have to sign up for Medicare this 12 months should you don’t need to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare nicely after sixty five, you should half HSA contributions six months before you sign as much as avoid tax penalties as a result of Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can continue contributing to your HSA as long as you’re not on Medicare.

There are deadlines for enrolling in several parts of Medicare. We explain these deadlines and the penalties you may accrue should you miss them.<p>
