<p>A late enrollment penalty could also be applicable if you didn't sign up for Medicare Part B if you had been first eligible.

Work together with your main care provider and your family to choose a plan you could afford and that has the coverages you’ll use probably the most. Advantage plans limit what you'll be able to pay out-of-pocket for coverage.<p>
