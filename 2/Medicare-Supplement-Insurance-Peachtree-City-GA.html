<p>I am now ready to see what, if any of the excellent bills, will be lined by Medicare Part A. Thank you in your help Mr. Backman. You don’t have to join Medicare this yr when you don’t wish to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare well after sixty five, you must half HSA contributions six months before you signal up to keep away from tax penalties because of Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule.
