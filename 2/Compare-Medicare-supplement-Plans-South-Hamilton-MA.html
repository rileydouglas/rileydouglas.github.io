<p>As a general rule, individuals who plan to continue to work (and have employer-sponsored health coverage) past age sixty five must confer with the employer-sponsored health plan to see whether or not they should enroll in Part B or not. This comes with an employer request for information form known as L564. Your employer can fill in that you’ve had coverage via them for the reason that month you turned 65, thus qualifying you for special enrollment into Medicare Part B. Unfortunately I’m not conversant in union laws mandating that you join Medicare at a given time.<p>
