Even when you didn’t work long enough to be entitled to Medicare benefits, you may still be eligible to enroll, but you might have to pay extra. Medicare MSA Plans combine a high deductible Medicare Advantage Plan and a belief or custodial savings account (as outlined and/or accredited by the IRS).<p>
<p>Many Advantage plans also embody further benefits, like imaginative and prescient and dental protections or Medicare prescription drug coverage (generally referred to as “Medicare Part D”). You might hear your medical service provider discuss with Medicare Advantage plans as a Part C plan.

You can't, however, pair a Medigap policy with an Advantage Plan.<p>
