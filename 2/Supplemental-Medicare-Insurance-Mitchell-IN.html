<p>As a basic rule, people who plan to proceed to work (and have employer-sponsored health coverage) previous age sixty five must check with the employer-sponsored health plan to see whether they need to enroll in Part B or not. This comes with an employer request for information form often known as L564. Your employer can fill in that you’ve had coverage through them for the reason that month you turned 65, thus qualifying you for special enrollment into Medicare Part B. Unfortunately I’m not acquainted with union laws mandating that you join Medicare at a given time.<p>
<p>When you file for your personal retirement benefit, you will receive an additional fee roughly equal to the quantity by which your retirement benefit exceeds your spousal benefit.
