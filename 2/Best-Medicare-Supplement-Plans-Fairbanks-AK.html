Once the OOP maximum is reached for a person underneath a Part C health plan, the plan pays 100% of medical companies for the remainder of the calendar 12 months. That safety has no lifetime maximum, one other downside with Medicare Part A which has a lifetime restrict on inpatient hospitalization coverage.
