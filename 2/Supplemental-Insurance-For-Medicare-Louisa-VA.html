Krugman cites all the acquainted figures from the rest of the developed world, the place some mix of public insurance with some private elements manages to cover nearly everyone and at a much decrease cost than within the United States. But that less-private system of health care been taken off the desk on this country by the private company interests who revenue from the costly mess of a health care system we have now.
