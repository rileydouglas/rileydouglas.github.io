<p>As a basic rule, individuals who plan to proceed to work (and have employer-sponsored health coverage) past age 65 need to discuss with the employer-sponsored health plan to see whether they should enroll in Part B or not. This comes with an employer request for info form generally known as L564.

<p>The Medicare Rights Center was not able to confirm that all ministries work this manner, but it might be sensible for you to think about that your ministry has such a requirement. Your evaluation should include whether or not there may be coverage for pharmaceuticals. These are not lined by Parts A or B, however usually require a Part D drug plan from a private insurer.
