<p>I am now ready to see what, if any of the excellent payments, will be covered by Medicare Part A. Thank you on your help Mr. Backman. You don’t have to enroll in Medicare this year when you don’t need to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare nicely after sixty five, you must half HSA contributions six months before you signal as much as avoid tax penalties because of Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can proceed contributing to your HSA so long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to stop contributions six months previous to retiring/signing up for Medicare because if you enroll nicely after age 65 (which it sounds such as you’re planning to do), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>
