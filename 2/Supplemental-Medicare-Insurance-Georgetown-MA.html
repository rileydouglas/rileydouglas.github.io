Medigap plans, like Medicare Advantage plans, are provided through private insurance companies, and are available for buy by way of brokers like eHealth Insurance Services, Inc.

Beginning in 2019, Medicare Advantage plans also can require enrollees to use “step therapy” for Part B medicine, that means that they're required to try some specific medication before they obtain approval to strive different medicine.
