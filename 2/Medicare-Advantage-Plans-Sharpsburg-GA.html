<p>As a general rule, people who plan to continue to work (and have employer-sponsored health coverage) past age sixty five have to check with the employer-sponsored health plan to see whether or not they should enroll in Part B or not. This comes with an employer request for information form generally known as L564. Your employer can fill in that you’ve had coverage by way of them since the month you turned 65, thus qualifying you for special enrollment into Medicare Part B. Unfortunately I’m not acquainted with union laws mandating that you sign up for Medicare at a given time.<p>
<p>If you don’t enroll in Part B, your insurer will “claw again” the quantity it paid in your care when it finds out. At that time, you would want to enroll in Part B, but would possibly now not qualify for the SEP should you delayed enrolling for more than 8 months. If you’re satisfied along with your current Medicare plan, you don’t must take any motion.

If you aren’t getting benefits from Social Security at least four months earlier than you turn sixty five, you'll want to enroll with Social Security to get Part A and Part B.
