<p>If you did not enroll in prescription drug coverage during IEP, you possibly can sign up for prescription drug coverage through the Annual Election Period that runs yearly from October 15 to December 7.

<p>To request a reduction in that revenue-related quantity due to a life-changing occasion like retiring, the Social Security Administration has a form you possibly can fill out. Some recipients won't pay the total $one hundred forty four.60 normal premium because of a "maintain harmless" provision that forestalls their Part B premiums from rising greater than their Social Security cost-of-dwelling adjustment, or COLA.
