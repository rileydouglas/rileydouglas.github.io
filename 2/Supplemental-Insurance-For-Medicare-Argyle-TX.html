<p>I am now ready to see what, if any of the excellent bills, shall be lined by Medicare Part A. Thank you in your help Mr. Backman. You don’t have to enroll in Medicare this 12 months if you don’t wish to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare nicely after 65, you need to half HSA contributions six months earlier than you signal up to avoid tax penalties because of Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can proceed contributing to your HSA so long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to stop contributions six months previous to retiring/signing up for Medicare because should you enroll properly after age sixty five (which it sounds such as you’re planning on doing), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>

<p>When chatting with the company they repeated that but didn’t say what communication they had been talking about. I can’t discover anything on their web site and before I spend an hour on hold with SSA I thought I would ask you. Hi Marcia, Both you and your husband should contemplate enrolling for Medicare Part B right when he retires.
