<p>I am now waiting to see what, if any of the excellent bills, might be coated by Medicare Part A. Thank you in your assist Mr. Backman. You don’t have to join Medicare this yr when you don’t want to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare nicely after 65, you need to half HSA contributions six months earlier than you signal up to avoid tax penalties as a result of Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can proceed contributing to your HSA as long as you’re not on Medicare.
