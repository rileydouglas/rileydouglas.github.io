While prescription drug coverage is an important health benefit, prescription drug coverage in a Marketplace or SHOP health plan isn’t required to be no less than as good as Medicare Part D coverage.<p>
<p>The annual deductible for Part B will rise to $198, which is $thirteen greater than the $185 deductible in 2019. If you're on Medicare, the cost of your coverage for physician's appointments and different outpatient companies is about to rise.
