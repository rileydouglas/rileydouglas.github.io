<p>Medicare Advantage, also referred to as Medicare Part C, is health coverage offered by private insurance companies. Medicare Advantage plans offer the same benefits as Original Medicare and often consists of further coverage such as prescribed drugs, dental, vision, and hearing.

Territories who're already amassing Social Security—either disability or retirement—are mechanically enrolled into Part A and Part B when they’re first eligible.<p>
<p>And Medicare will certainly not require you to maintain it when you sign up. Once your group health coverage ends, you get a particular enrollment period that lasts eight months. Though you don’t have to enroll in Medicare at age 65 when you have coverage through a qualified group health plan, doing so might make sense if that plan isn’t heavily subsidized by your employer.<p>

If you signed up for Medicare through Social Security, then you will want to contact them to drop Part B coverage. If your Medicare coverage has started and you wish to drop Part B, contact Social Security for instructions on the way to submit a signed request. Your coverage will end the first day of the month after Social Security gets your request. If you are under 65 and receiving sure disability benefits from Social Security or the Railroad Retirement Board, you'll be automatically enrolled in Original Medicare, Part A and Part B, after 24 months of disability benefits.<p>
