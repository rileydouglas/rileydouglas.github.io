Some of UC’s retiree medical plans have Medicare variations and a few have a corresponding associate plan (UC Care, CORE, UC Blue & Gold). If your present retiree plan has a Medicare version or associate plan, you’ll be transferred into that plan whenever you turn sixty five, as soon as Medicare has permitted your enrollment form.<p>
