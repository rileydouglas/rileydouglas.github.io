<p>I’m guessing you could have greater Social Security benefits than your husband, so your Part B premium this year will also be greater than his.

Medicare pays a fixed amount on your care every month to the businesses offering Medicare Advantage Plans. In most states, the majority of enrollees are in HMOs; nevertheless, in 12 states , the vast majority of enrollees are in local PPOs .<p>
<p>As a general rule, individuals who plan to continue to work (and have employer-sponsored health coverage) past age sixty five need to discuss with the employer-sponsored health plan to see whether they should enroll in Part B or not. This comes with an employer request for information form often known as L564. Your employer can fill in that you simply’ve had coverage by way of them for the reason that month you turned 65, thus qualifying you for particular enrollment into Medicare Part B.
