<p>If you might be eligible for premium-free Part A and you don’t enroll in Part A and B earlier than your 65th birthday, you could lose your UC-sponsored medical coverage and be charged penalties by RASC and lifelong penalties by Medicare.

Sending in the info by this date allows for the well timed processing of your enrollment into the Medicare plan. Ninety days earlier than your 65th birthday, RASC will ship you a letter with details about enrolling in Medicare.
