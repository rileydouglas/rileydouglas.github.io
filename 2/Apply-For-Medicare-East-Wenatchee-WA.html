<p>Generally you possibly can enroll in Medicare solely during the Medicare general enrollment interval . Generally, if an individual remains to be working and has employer-sponsored Group Health Plan coverage primarily based on that employment, they'll delay enrollment in Part B and may enroll later throughout a SEP. For instance, employer coverage for retirees or through COBRA doesn’t depend as current employment, so these people don’t qualify for a SEP to enroll in Medicare later.<p>
