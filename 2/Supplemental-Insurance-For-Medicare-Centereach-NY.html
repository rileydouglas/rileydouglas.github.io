Some recipients will not pay the total $one hundred forty four.60 normal premium because of a "hold harmless" provision that forestalls their Part B premiums from rising greater than their Social Security cost-of-residing adjustment, or COLA.

Only give your Medicare Number to medical doctors, pharmacists, other health care suppliers, your insurers, or folks you belief to work with Medicare in your behalf. If you’re in a Medicare Advantage Plan , your Medicare Advantage Plan ID card is your primary card for Medicare—you should still hold and use it whenever you need care. And, when you have a Medicare drug plan, remember to hold that card as nicely.<p>
