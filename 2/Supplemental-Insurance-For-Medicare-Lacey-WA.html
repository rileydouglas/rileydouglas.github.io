<p>You can enroll in a Medicare Advantage plan whenever you’re first eligible for Medicare, or in the course of the annual Medicare open enrollment interval in the fall . If you’re enrolled in each Medicare Part A and Part B , you’re eligible to enroll in a Medigap plan to supplement your Medicare coverage. You’ll have a six-month guaranteed-issue window throughout which you'll sign up for any Medigap plan available in your area. In most states and most circumstances, you’ll have to go through medical underwriting should you decide to apply for a Medigap plan after that window ends. During the 5-star enrollment interval (December 8 – November 30), individuals who live in an area with a 5-star Medicare Part D or Medicare Advantage plan can switch to that plan if they select to do so.<p>
