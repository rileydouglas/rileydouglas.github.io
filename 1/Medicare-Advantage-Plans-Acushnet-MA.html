<p>As a common rule, people who plan to continue to work (and have employer-sponsored health coverage) previous age 65 must check with the employer-sponsored health plan to see whether they should enroll in Part B or not.

Your employer can fill in that you’ve had coverage through them for the reason that month you turned 65, thus qualifying you for special enrollment into Medicare Part B. Unfortunately I’m not familiar with union laws mandating that you sign up for Medicare at a given time.<p>
<p>You and your spouse pay separate premiums for Medicare benefits underneath Medicare Part B, and Medicare Part D when you sign up for it. If one or each of you select to enroll in a Medicare Advantage plan, you will proceed to pay individually the Medicare Part B premium and probably a separate plan premium. For instance, you may decide to stick with Original Medicare, and sign up for a stand-alone Medicare Part D prescription drug plan.<p>
