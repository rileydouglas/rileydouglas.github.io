<p>Recently, I began an element-time job and saw that the company in withdrawal cash for Medicare. When very small employers join together with different employers in situations like this, the plan will provide major coverage so long as a minimum of one of many employers has 20+ employees. But employers can even ask for exceptions to the first/secondary rule in that circumstance, so he’ll have to check together with his group plan to see what their particular guidelines are.
