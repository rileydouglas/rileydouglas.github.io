If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare properly after sixty five, you should half HSA contributions six months earlier than you sign up to keep away from tax penalties as a result of Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can proceed contributing to your HSA so long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to stop contributions six months prior to retiring/signing up for Medicare as a result of should you enroll nicely after age sixty five (which it sounds like you’re planning on doing), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>
<p>These income limits apply in 2020, and are indexed for inflation. There is no longer a donut gap by way of the maximum quantity that enrollees could be charged when they fill prescriptions. But the donut gap still exists by way of how insurers design their coverage , how total drug prices are counted, and who covers the bulk of the price of the medicine (the drug plan versus the manufacturer; see Figure 4 here).<p>
