If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare properly after 65, you need to half HSA contributions six months earlier than you sign as much as keep away from tax penalties as a result of Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can continue contributing to your HSA as long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to stop contributions six months previous to retiring/signing up for Medicare as a result of if you enroll properly after age 65 (which it sounds such as you’re planning on doing), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>
