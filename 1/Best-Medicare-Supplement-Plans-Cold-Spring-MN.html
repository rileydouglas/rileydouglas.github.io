<p>I am now ready to see what, if any of the outstanding bills, shall be coated by Medicare Part A. Thank you on your help Mr. Backman. You don’t have to join Medicare this year if you don’t wish to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare well after sixty five, you must half HSA contributions six months earlier than you sign up to keep away from tax penalties due to Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can proceed contributing to your HSA so long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to cease contributions six months prior to retiring/signing up for Medicare as a result of when you enroll properly after age 65 (which it sounds like you’re planning to do), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>
