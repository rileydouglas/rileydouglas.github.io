If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare nicely after 65, you must half HSA contributions six months before you sign as much as keep away from tax penalties as a result of Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can proceed contributing to your HSA as long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to stop contributions six months previous to retiring/signing up for Medicare as a result of when you enroll properly after age 65 (which it sounds like you’re planning to do), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>

Look for specific Medicare drug plan costs, after which name the plans you are excited about to get more particulars. Most individuals do not pay a month-to-month premium for Part A (generally called "premium-free Part A"). If you paid Medicare taxes for less than 30 quarters, the standard Part A premium is $458.

<p>You’ll receive your Medicare card within the mail about three months before you turn sixty five, and your coverage will take effect the primary of the month you flip 65.

Your Medicare Advantage plan will take the place of each elements, and can likely additionally include Part D prescription drug coverage.<p>
<p>But it looks like you’ll be enrolling at Medicare at sixty five, during which case you don’t get retro benefits since you weren’t entitled to them previous to sixty five. Hi Karen, when you enroll in Medicare Part A, you will be penalized for continuing to contribute to an HSA. Your Part A will take effect again to the date you qualified for Medicare .<p>
