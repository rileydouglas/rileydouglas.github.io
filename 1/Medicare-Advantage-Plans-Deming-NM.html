<p>Some might pay a portion of out-of-community care, whereas others will cover only doctors and services which might be in the HMO or PPO community.

These plans are generally known as Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug plans or MA-PDs.<p>
<p>However, you will want to prove that your private circumstances have changed, and that you're required to return to work. If you’re approaching retirement, likelihood is you’ve already received a financial plan mapped out to help you easily transition from full-time work to a lifetime of leisure.

If you've health coverage by way of present employment (both via your work or your partner’s employer), you could determine to delay Medicare Part B enrollment. You should speak with your employer’s health benefits administrator so that you understand how your present coverage works with Medicare and what the implications could be should you drop Medicare Part B.<p>
