<p>I would counsel addressing that concern with a union representative and going from there. Some folks select to pay for health coverage via an employer plus Medicare. If you’re not being given a selection then that’s something to first address with the entity that’s forcing you to acquire Medicare.<p>
<p>Medicare deposits funds that are withdrawn tax free to pay for qualified health care providers.
