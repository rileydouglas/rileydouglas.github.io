Prior authorization is most frequently required for comparatively expensive services, corresponding to inpatient hospital stays, skilled nursing facility stays, and Part B medication, but occasionally required for preventive companies. Beginning in 2019, Medicare Advantage plans also can require enrollees to make use of “step therapy” for Part B medication, which means that they are required to strive some particular medicine earlier than they receive approval to attempt different medicine.

Advantage plans restrict what you possibly can pay out-of-pocket for coverage.<p>
