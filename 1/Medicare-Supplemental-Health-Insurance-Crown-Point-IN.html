<p>It’s administered by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services , a division of the U.S. Medicare beneficiaries are usually senior citizens aged sixty five and older. Adults with certain approved medical situations (corresponding to Lou Gehrig’s disease) or qualifying everlasting disabilities may be eligible for Medicare benefits. You can sign up for Part A at 65 when you choose and use it as secondary insurance in case you want hospital care.<p>
