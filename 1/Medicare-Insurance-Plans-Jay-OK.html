Generally, you’re not forced to maintain medical insurance through a job if you don’t need it.<p>
<p>When talking to the corporate they repeated that but didn’t say what communication they have been talking about. I can’t discover something on their web site and before I spend an hour on maintain with SSA I thought I would ask you. Hi Marcia, Both you and your husband should consider enrolling for Medicare Part B proper when he retires.
