Just as crucial benefit of Part C plans is the annual out of pocket spend protection, the most important determinant of monthly premium differences is the scale of that protection. By regulation, a Part C beneficiary can not spend more than $6700 out of pocket annually on medical services; it is plans with this restrict which have the lowest premiums.
