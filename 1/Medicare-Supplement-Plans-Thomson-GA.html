<p>Remember that if you do not enroll in Medicare Part B during your Special Enrollment Period, you’ll have to attend till the next General Enrollment Period, which happens from January 1 to March 31 annually. You could then need to pay a late-enrollment penalty for Medicare Part B because you could have had Part B and did not enroll. If you owe a late-enrollment penalty, you’ll pay a 10% larger premium for every 12-month interval that you just were eligible for Medicare Part B but didn’t sign up for it. You might should pay this higher premium for as long as you’re enrolled in Medicare.<p>
