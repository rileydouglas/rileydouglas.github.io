If you might be required to pay a premium for Part A as a retiree, you aren't required to enroll in Medicare Parts A and B.

Some of UC’s retiree medical plans have Medicare versions and some have a corresponding partner plan (UC Care, CORE, UC Blue & Gold).

Across all Medicare Advantage plans, the common premium in 2020 is about $23/month, and is anticipated to lower to $21/month in 2021. Supplemental coverage, including Medigap plans, can pay some or the entire Part A deductible on your behalf.

<p>Generally you'll be able to enroll in Medicare only in the course of the Medicare common enrollment interval .
