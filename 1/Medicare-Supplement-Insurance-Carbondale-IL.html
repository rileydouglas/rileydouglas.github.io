<p>When you file on your personal retirement benefit, you'll obtain an extra payment roughly equal to the amount by which your retirement benefit exceeds your spousal benefit. Social Security may call this entire amount your retirement benefit, but we think that’s deceptive. It’s actually an extra retirement benefit and certainly not a retirement benefit all by itself.

You will share in the prices of your prescribed drugs according to the precise plan by which you’re enrolled. Those costs can include a deductible, a flat copayment amount, or a share of the full drug cost (known as “coinsurance”). Medicare Part C, or Medicare Advantage, insurance usually contains every type of Medicare coverage in one health plan. It’s offered by private insurance companies contracted via CMS to offer a Medicare benefits package as an alternative choice to Original Medicare.<p>
