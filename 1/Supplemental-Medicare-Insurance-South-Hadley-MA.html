<p>But you’ll nonetheless have to pay the government a premium for Part B, along with the premium you pay for Medicare Advantage (which may be $zero, relying on the plan).

But if it’s not during the person’s one-time Medigap enrollment window, the insurer will doubtless use medical underwriting to determine whether or not to problem the policy and at what value.<p>

Generally talking, essentially the most that may happen if you fund an HSA whereas being eligible for Medicare is that you just’re assessed a tax penalty on the contributions you put in tax-free throughout that point. You should be okay to keep making HSA contributions through June 2020 because Medicare retroactive benefits can solely date back to your 65th birthday.<p>
<p>The annual deductible for Part B will rise to $198, which is $13 more than the $185 deductible in 2019.

<p>Keep in mind that your new coverage starts on the first day of the month after you submit your enrollment application, which means should you apply on February eight, your new Medicare plan wouldn’t start till March 1.
