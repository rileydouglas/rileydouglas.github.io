<p>For domestic partners (identical- and opposite-gender), Medicare will pay major to your UC medical plan. If you might be required to pay a premium for Part A as a retiree, you aren't required to enroll in Medicare Parts A and B. However, UC does require that you just send in a denial letter from Social Security to maintain your present coverage. Some of UC’s retiree medical plans have Medicare variations and a few have a corresponding partner plan (UC Care, CORE, UC Blue & Gold). If your present retiree plan has a Medicare model or partner plan, you’ll be transferred into that plan when you flip 65, as soon as Medicare has approved your enrollment form.<p>
