Switch from Original Medicare to Medicare Advantage (so long as you’re enrolled in each Medicare Part A and Part B, and you live in the Medicare Advantage plan’s service area).<p>
<p>As a retiree this happens when you turn sixty five; as a UC worker this occurs if you retire and you might be sixty five or older. Medicare Part A is often premium-free, but there is a monthly premium for Part B coverage, paid to the Social Security Administration.<p>
