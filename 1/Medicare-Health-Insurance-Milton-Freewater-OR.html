<p>I am now ready to see what, if any of the excellent payments, might be covered by Medicare Part A. Thank you for your assist Mr. Backman. You don’t have to enroll in Medicare this year when you don’t wish to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare properly after sixty five, you must half HSA contributions six months before you sign up to avoid tax penalties because of Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can continue contributing to your HSA as long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to cease contributions six months previous to retiring/signing up for Medicare because when you enroll well after age 65 (which it sounds such as you’re planning to do), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>
