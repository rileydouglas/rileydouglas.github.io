Krugman cites all of the acquainted figures from the rest of the developed world, where some mix of public insurance with some private components manages to cover nearly everybody and at a much decrease cost than within the United States. But that much less-private system of health care been taken off the table in this nation by the private corporate interests who revenue from the costly mess of a health care system we now have now.
