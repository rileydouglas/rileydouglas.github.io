<p>Generally you can enroll in Medicare only during the Medicare general enrollment period . Generally, if a person is still working and has employer-sponsored Group Health Plan coverage primarily based on that employment, they will delay enrollment in Part B and might enroll later throughout a SEP.

This common contains zero-premium plans and Medicare Advantage plans that don’t include Part D coverage — if we only look at plans that do have premiums and that do embody Part D coverage, the average premium is about $36/month.<p>
