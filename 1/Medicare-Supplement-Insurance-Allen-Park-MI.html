You can proceed contributing to your HSA as long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to cease contributions six months prior to retiring/signing up for Medicare as a result of should you enroll well after age 65 (which it sounds such as you’re planning to do), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>
<p>And Medicare will definitely not require you to maintain it once you join. Once your group health coverage ends, you get a special enrollment interval that lasts eight months.
