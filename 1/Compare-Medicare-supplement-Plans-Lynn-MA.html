<p>Third, individuals who reside in two completely different geographical areas of the nation at totally different times of the year (largely so-referred to as snowbirds) find it troublesome to reside with the geographic restrictions of most public Part C plans. The Part C danger adjusted funds to Medicare Advantage plans are designed to restrict this churn between forms of Medicare (managed vs. FFS), however it's unclear how effective that equalization program is. In addition Medicare Advantage plans may cover benefits differently. For example, plans that require higher out-of-pocket costs than Medicare Parts A or B for some benefits, corresponding to skilled nursing facility care, may supply decrease copayments for physician visits to stability their benefits package deal.<p>
<p>But these averages mask extensive regional and useful differences. Just as an important good thing about Part C plans is the annual out of pocket spend safety, the most important determinant of month-to-month premium differences is the scale of that protection.
