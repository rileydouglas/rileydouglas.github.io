<p>Medicare Advantage, also known as Medicare Part C, is health coverage offered by private insurance corporations. Medicare Advantage plans offer the identical benefits as Original Medicare and sometimes includes additional coverage similar to prescribed drugs, dental, vision, and hearing. MA plans differ with respect to what benefits they supply, out-of-pocket prices corresponding to premiums, deductibles, and co-pays, and whether they provide prescription drug coverage. It is necessary to keep in mind that in case you are pleased with your Medicare benefits, whether you might be in traditional Medicare or an MA plan, you do not HAVE to alter when the opportunity arises. In addition, these with coverage through their current or former employer ought to check to see how any changes may have an effect on such coverage.<p>

Having Part A will disqualify any HSA contributions he makes for that portion of the 12 months, which may result in penalties.

That mentioned, you must qualify for Special Enrollment into Part B if you do decide to delay enrollment.<p>
<p>Generally you possibly can enroll in Medicare solely in the course of the Medicare general enrollment interval . Generally, if a person is still working and has employer-sponsored Group Health Plan coverage based mostly on that employment, they'll delay enrollment in Part B and might enroll later throughout a SEP.
