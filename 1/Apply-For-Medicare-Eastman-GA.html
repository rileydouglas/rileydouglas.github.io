<p>I am now waiting to see what, if any of the excellent bills, shall be lined by Medicare Part A. Thank you for your assist Mr. Backman. You don’t have to join Medicare this yr should you don’t want to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare properly after sixty five, you must half HSA contributions six months earlier than you sign up to avoid tax penalties as a result of Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can continue contributing to your HSA as long as you’re not on Medicare.
