<p>But these averages masks broad regional and helpful differences. Just as crucial benefit of Part C plans is the annual out of pocket spend safety, the main determinant of month-to-month premium variations is the size of that safety.

Note that an OOP restrict just isn't a deductible as is usually reported.<p>
