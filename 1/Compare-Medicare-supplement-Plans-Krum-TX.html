<p>I am now waiting to see what, if any of the outstanding bills, shall be lined by Medicare Part A. Thank you on your assist Mr. Backman. You don’t have to sign up for Medicare this yr if you don’t want to.

You can proceed contributing to your HSA so long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to cease contributions six months previous to retiring/signing up for Medicare because when you enroll properly after age 65 (which it sounds such as you’re planning to do), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>
<p>Most Americans begin amassing social security as soon as they will. And whereas this is nice should you don’t have a choice, when you can, holding off for a couple of years will allow you a much bigger payout later.
