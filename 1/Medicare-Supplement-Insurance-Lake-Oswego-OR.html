If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare well after sixty five, you need to half HSA contributions six months earlier than you signal as much as keep away from tax penalties as a result of Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can continue contributing to your HSA so long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to cease contributions six months prior to retiring/signing up for Medicare because should you enroll properly after age 65 (which it sounds like you’re planning on doing), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>
<p>You're entitled to maintain working as long as you want, and once you turn 65 you're entitled to entry your super benefits whereas still working. The preservation age is for those who want to cease working, and entry their superannuation.

<p>Medicare won’t reject your enrollment in case you have another health plan.
