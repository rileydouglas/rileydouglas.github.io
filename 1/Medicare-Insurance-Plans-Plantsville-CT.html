<p>For home companions (identical- and opposite-gender), Medicare can pay primary to your UC medical plan. If you might be required to pay a premium for Part A as a retiree, you are not required to enroll in Medicare Parts A and B. However, UC does require that you ship in a denial letter from Social Security to maintain your current coverage.

<p>A late enrollment penalty may be relevant when you did not join Medicare Part B whenever you had been first eligible.
