Just as crucial advantage of Part C plans is the annual out of pocket spend safety, the main determinant of month-to-month premium differences is the size of that safety. By regulation, a Part C beneficiary can't spend more than $6700 out of pocket yearly on medical providers; it is plans with this restrict which have the lowest premiums.
