<p>Medicare Advantage Plans are another method to get your Medicare Part A and Part B coverage. Medicare Advantage Plans, generally referred to as “Part C” or “MA Plans,” are offered by Medicare-approved private firms that should follow guidelines set by Medicare.

Medicare Part B helps pay for providers from docs and different health care providers, outpatient care, house health care, durable medical tools, and a few preventive services. The program helps with the price of health care, but it does not cover all medical bills or the cost of most lengthy-term care. If you select to have Original Medicare coverage, you should buy a Medicare Supplement Insurance policy from a private insurance firm. Medicare is our nation's health insurance program for individuals age sixty five or older.<p>
