<p>You could should pay a higher premium for late enrollment in Part A and/or a higher premium for late enrollment in Part B. The Medicare Part D plans are optionally available and don’t at all times occur mechanically. Prescription drug coverage is used rolled into Medicare Advantage plans. If you enroll in the course of the general enrollment interval, your coverage will start July 1 of that yr. You may must pay a late enrollment penalty if you didn’t join Medicare whenever you had been first eligible.<p>
