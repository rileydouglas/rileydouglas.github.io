<p>You won’t need to pay extra money on your health care when you hit your yearly limit. Original Medicare has no limitations on how much you pay for your care. If you regularly require excessive-cost medical care, you could possibly save money if you limit your bills with an Advantage plan.<p>
<p>Many Medicare Supplement plans don't cover benefits like imaginative and prescient, dental, eyeglasses, hearing aids, or prescription drug coverage. If you need prescription drugs, you would have to enroll in a standalone Medicare Part D prescription drug plan. Medicare Advantage, also known as Part C, replaces Original Medicare should you enroll in coverage. Advantage plans are provided by private insurance companies and are required to cover everything you'd have with Original Medicare.<p>
