<p>Plan prices are generally lower than these of different Medicare Advantage plan sorts, however you’re often restricted to doctors within the plan’s provider network. Medicare Advantage plans may provide extra (“supplemental”) benefits that are not offered in traditional Medicare, and might use rebate dollars to help cover the cost of further benefits.

A PFFS is a particular cost plan that provides provider flexibility.<p>

Some of UC’s retiree medical plans have Medicare versions and a few have a corresponding companion plan (UC Care, CORE, UC Blue & Gold). If your present retiree plan has a Medicare version or partner plan, you’ll be transferred into that plan whenever you flip sixty five, once Medicare has accredited your enrollment form.<p>
