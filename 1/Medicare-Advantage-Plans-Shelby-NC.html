<p>I am now waiting to see what, if any of the outstanding bills, shall be coated by Medicare Part A. Thank you for your assist Mr. Backman. You don’t have to join Medicare this year if you don’t wish to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare properly after 65, you need to half HSA contributions six months before you signal as much as keep away from tax penalties due to Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can proceed contributing to your HSA as long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to stop contributions six months previous to retiring/signing up for Medicare as a result of when you enroll nicely after age 65 (which it sounds like you’re planning on doing), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>
