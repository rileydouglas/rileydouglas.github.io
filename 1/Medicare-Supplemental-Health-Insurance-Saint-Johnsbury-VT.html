<p>As a basic rule, people who plan to continue to work (and have employer-sponsored health coverage) past age sixty five have to check with the employer-sponsored health plan to see whether or not they should enroll in Part B or not.

If your present retiree plan has a Medicare model or associate plan, you’ll be transferred into that plan if you turn sixty five, as soon as Medicare has permitted your enrollment form.<p>
<p>I am at present single and separated (proceedings are underway for a property/belongings settlement with my estranged partner). Please note that the low-price cap amount is a ‘lifetime’ limit.
