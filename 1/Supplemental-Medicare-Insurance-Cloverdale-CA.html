Krugman cites all the familiar figures from the rest of the developed world, where some mix of public insurance with some private parts manages to cover virtually everyone and at a much lower cost than within the United States. But that much less-private system of health care been taken off the desk on this country by the private company pursuits who profit from the costly mess of a health care system we've now.
