<p>I am now ready to see what, if any of the outstanding payments, shall be lined by Medicare Part A. Thank you for your assist Mr. Backman.

If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare well after 65, you need to half HSA contributions six months before you signal as much as avoid tax penalties due to Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can continue contributing to your HSA so long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to stop contributions six months previous to retiring/signing up for Medicare as a result of if you enroll nicely after age 65 (which it sounds such as you’re planning on doing), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>
