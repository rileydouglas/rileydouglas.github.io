<p>If you aren't signing up for Medicare at sixty five and presently have company provided group coverage, are you required to confirm this with Medicare?

How do they confirm whether you could have or didn’t have a bunch health plan?<p>
<p>Medicare is a national medical insurance program that covers millions of people and involves a fair greater number of healthcare providers and providers. If you have missed the Fall Medicare Open Enrollment period, there's a Medicare Advantage Open Enrollment Period, which lasts from January 1 to March 31 every year.

I’ll be getting benefits from Social Security or the Railroad Retirement Board a minimum of 4 months before I flip sixty five. In most circumstances, it depends on whether or not you’re getting Social Security benefits.<p>
