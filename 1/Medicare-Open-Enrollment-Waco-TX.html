<p>I am now waiting to see what, if any of the excellent bills, will be lined by Medicare Part A. Thank you on your help Mr. Backman. You don’t have to join Medicare this yr should you don’t want to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare well after sixty five, you must half HSA contributions six months before you signal as much as avoid tax penalties as a result of Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can continue contributing to your HSA as long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to cease contributions six months prior to retiring/signing up for Medicare because should you enroll well after age sixty five (which it sounds such as you’re planning to do), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>
<p>And Medicare will certainly not require you to keep it when you join. Once your group health coverage ends, you get a particular enrollment interval that lasts eight months.
