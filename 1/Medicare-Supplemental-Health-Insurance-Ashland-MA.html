Enroll within the prescription drug plan if you’re first eligible to do so, in the course of the IEP for Part D.<p>
<p>If you might be eligible for premium-free Part A and also you don’t enroll in Part A and B before your sixty fifth birthday, you can lose your UC-sponsored medical coverage and be charged penalties by RASC and lifelong penalties by Medicare. Ninety days before you flip sixty five, RASC will ship you the Medicare forms you may must fill out, together with the date UC wants you to enroll in Medicare and return the forms. Sending in the information by this date permits for the well timed processing of your enrollment into the Medicare plan.

I can’t tell you when to enroll in Social Security, but I can tell you there are benefits to waiting. You can delay benefits all the best way until age 70 and keep boosting them in the process.<p>
