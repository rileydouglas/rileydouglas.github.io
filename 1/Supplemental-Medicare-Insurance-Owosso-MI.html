Once the OOP most is reached for an individual under a Part C health plan, the plan pays 100% of medical companies for the rest of the calendar year. That safety has no lifetime most, another problem with Medicare Part A which has a lifetime restrict on inpatient hospitalization coverage. But the Part C OOP limit doesn't apply to a Part C plan's Part-D-like self-administered drug coverage .<p>
