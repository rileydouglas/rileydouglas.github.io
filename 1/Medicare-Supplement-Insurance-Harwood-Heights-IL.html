If you're required to pay a premium for Part A as a retiree, you are not required to enroll in Medicare Parts A and B.

Some of UC’s retiree medical plans have Medicare versions and a few have a corresponding associate plan (UC Care, CORE, UC Blue & Gold). If your current retiree plan has a Medicare version or associate plan, you’ll be transferred into that plan if you turn sixty five, as soon as Medicare has permitted your enrollment form.<p>

Creditable coverage contains the insurance provided to you or your partner through work.<p>
<p>Keep in thoughts that your new coverage starts on the primary day of the month after you submit your enrollment application, which means when you apply on February eight, your new Medicare plan wouldn’t start until March 1.
