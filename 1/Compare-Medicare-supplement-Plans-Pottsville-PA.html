<p>When you enroll with a Medicare Advantage Plan, you pay 2 premiums every month — a premium in your Advantage coverage and a separate premium for Medicare Part B coverage. These plans often also have greater deductibles, so you must rigorously compare these plans together with your revenue earlier than making a decision. Instead of merely responding to a gross sales pitch from an insurance agent or to an ad, check all the Medicare options in your area. Compare plans using the Medicare Options Compare tool at Medicare.gov/mppf, taking a look at both premiums and complete estimated prices for folks like your self.

<p>Medicare is a national health insurance program that covers millions of individuals and includes an even higher variety of healthcare providers and providers. If you've missed the Fall Medicare Open Enrollment interval, there is a Medicare Advantage Open Enrollment Period, which lasts from January 1 to March 31 yearly. During this different Medicare Open Enrollment period, you'll be able to swap from one Medicare Advantage plan to a different, and you might return to Original Medicare. If you come to Part A and Part B coverage, you can usually enroll in a stand-alone Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Plan.

<p>During the Fall Medicare Open Enrollment Period, Medicare beneficiaries can add, change, or drop Medicare health plans and/or prescription drug coverage for the following 12 months . You can get a standalone plan to use alongside unique Medicare. Or, you can sign up for an Advantage Plan , which generally includes prescription drug coverage.

If you’re in a Medicare Advantage Plan , your Medicare Advantage Plan ID card is your primary card for Medicare—you must still maintain and use it everytime you want care. And, in case you have a Medicare drug plan, make sure to hold that card as well.<p>
