Some recipients won't pay the complete $one hundred forty four.60 standard premium as a result of a "hold harmless" provision that stops their Part B premiums from rising more than their Social Security cost-of-dwelling adjustment, or COLA.

Having a authorized will will guarantee your final wishes are met and defend your property. A energy of legal professional is helpful for finances, and a living will — also called an advance medical directive — will legally implement your healthcare choices.
