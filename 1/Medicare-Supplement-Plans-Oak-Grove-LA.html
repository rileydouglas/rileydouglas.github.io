You don’t have to enroll in Medicare this yr should you don’t wish to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare properly after 65, you need to half HSA contributions six months earlier than you sign up to keep away from tax penalties because of Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can continue contributing to your HSA as long as you’re not on Medicare.
