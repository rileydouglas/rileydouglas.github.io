<p>I am now ready to see what, if any of the excellent bills, shall be coated by Medicare Part A. Thank you for your help Mr. Backman. You don’t have to join Medicare this year when you don’t want to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare nicely after 65, you must half HSA contributions six months earlier than you signal up to avoid tax penalties due to Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can continue contributing to your HSA as long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to cease contributions six months previous to retiring/signing up for Medicare as a result of should you enroll properly after age 65 (which it sounds like you’re planning to do), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>
