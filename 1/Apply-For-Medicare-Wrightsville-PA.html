<p>You can keep away from a pricey penalty if you meet the criteria outlined on this SEP. If you or your partner paid Medicare taxes no less than 10 years whereas working, you generally don’t need to pay a Medicare Part A premium. Because you and your partner enroll in Medicare separately, you may make completely different choices in the way you obtain your Medicare benefits. As a result of these choices, you may have variations in your Medicare benefits. There are four “components” to the Medicare insurance program, each one offering a sure set of Medicare benefits.<p>
<p>If you’re drawing Social Security, you’ll be mechanically enrolled. You can join or postpone your Part B by contacting the Social Security Administration directly.<p>
<p>Check with Social Security to see if you're required to pay a Part D premium. These Medicare premiums are in addition to any premium you pay to UC on your UC insurance. If you are sixty five and eligible for Medicare, you have 8 months to enroll in Original Medicare without a late penalty after the month your employment or employer coverage ends, whichever comes first.
