<p>I am now waiting to see what, if any of the excellent bills, shall be lined by Medicare Part A. Thank you in your help Mr. Backman. You don’t have to join Medicare this year when you don’t wish to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare well after sixty five, you should half HSA contributions six months before you signal as much as keep away from tax penalties because of Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can proceed contributing to your HSA so long as you’re not on Medicare.
