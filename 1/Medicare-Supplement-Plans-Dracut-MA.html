By legislation, a Part C beneficiary can't spend greater than $6700 out of pocket yearly on medical providers; it is plans with this limit that have the lowest premiums. Conversely, some Part C plans have OOP limits as little as $1500 annually but in fact -- for these plans -- the premium is larger.

If you haven’t maintained other creditable coverage, a late-enrollment penalty may apply. If you and/or your family members are coated under a UC worker plan or enrolled in TRICARE for Life, Medicare will be secondary to your UC medical plan.<p>
