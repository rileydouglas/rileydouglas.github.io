<p>Just do not forget that if you choose to wait to enroll in Part B, you’ll be charged a late enrollment penalty, and Part B coverage will cost you extra. You have to have both Part A and Part B to enroll in a Medicare Advantage plan or a Medicare Supplement plan. You don't need to enroll in Part B instantly, since you'll be charged a premium.

I’ll be getting benefits from Social Security or the Railroad Retirement Board no less than four months earlier than I turn sixty five. In most circumstances, it depends on whether you’re getting Social Security benefits.<p>
